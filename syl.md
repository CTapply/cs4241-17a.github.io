Course Description
---

This course explores the computational aspects of network information systems as embodied by the World Wide Web (WWW). Topics include: languages for document design, programming languages for executable content, scripting languages, design of WWW based human/computer interfaces, client/server network architecture models, high level network protocols (e.g., http), WWW network resource discovery and network security issues. Students in this course will be expected to complete a substantial software project (e.g., Java based user interface, HTML/CGI based information system, WWW search mechanisms, etc.). 

This course provides you with the foundation needed to construct Web applications. It provides you with an introduction to distributed computing paradigms for the Web as well as the knowledge for developing static and dynamic content for your Web applications. You will be exposed to various protocols for technologies currently used. We will focus on the underlying principles rather than just the latest technology or tool since these will pass, only to be replaced by new ones. The student who successfully finishes this course will be able to pursue further study into and practice of using Web software technologies.

Learning Goals
---

After successful completion of this course, you will be able to:

- Critically evaluate and deconstruct web applications.
- Identify opportunities for web-based resources and APIs in your organization.
- Evaluate the characteristics and structure of web applications you encounter to refine design options.
- Create functional and usable web applications, including front-end and back-end components.
- Apply knowledge of HTTP to design scalable web applications.

Required Text
---

There are no required texts for this course.
Everything you need is on the web.

If you're looking for js specific resources, I hear [JavaScript: The Good Parts](https://www.amazon.com/JavaScript-Good-Parts-Douglas-Crockford/dp/0596517742) is a favorite of many web developers.

Assignments
---
Request access to team GitHub [here](https://github.com/orgs/cs4241-16b/teams/class).

Assignments are the core of this course. 
Each assignment will focus on a particular aspect of web development, such as routes or sending data from server to client and vice versa. 
The lectures and labs will equip you with the background, theory, and technical skills to develop web applications.

Labs
---
Every week will include an in-class lab. These labs provide an opportunity for you to learn more about web application development, design, or technologies.

Exams
---
We'll have a midterm and final based on the readings, labs, assignments, and lectures. These help gauge how well you've understood the material.


Programming Language
---

We'll be using [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) with [node.js](http://nodejs.org/) to develop web applications in this course.

While JavaScript is the main language for front-end web application development, there are a variety of choices for back-end languages. Java, Python, Ruby, and many other languages have HTTP support. We'll be using node.js for simplicity and consistency.

Discussion / Questions
---

This term we will be using Slack for class discussion. 
The system is highly catered to getting you help fast and efficiently from classmates and myself. 

Rather than emailing questions to me or the staff, I encourage you to post your questions on Slack. 

Sign up for our [Slack Team](https://cs4241-16b.slack.com/x-94842639954-94842655618/signup).

Grading
---

Your course grade comes from three parts:

- Homework assignments (40%)
- Exams (30%)
- Project (30%)

I reserve the right to adjust the above if I see fit. 
As for grades-- 
To get an A, if you have a 90 average or better, you will get an A. 
If you have an 80 or better average you will get at least a B. 
If you have a 70 average or better you will get at least a C. 
I may adjust the threshold downward, but never up.

I do not accept late homework. 
If you do not have the homework done on time you will receive a zero for that assignment. 
You are expected to complete the assignment and have it deployed by the due date.
